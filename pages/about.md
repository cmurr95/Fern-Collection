**Fern represents a collective of rhizomatic archiving shared by five women.**  
For DreamLab 2021, five women, spanning across institutions, careers, locations, and interests, came together and unknowingly fulfilled fern's multiple definitions. Each of them submitted four images, and those images created a collection centered on the physical, mental, and emotional labor of people, particularly women.

In this collection, we hope you sense, echoing to the windlass, which hoists/hauls on ships, our desire not only to lift up those in our images and celebrate their agency but also to build upon networks of women/humans/all caring for, building with, and learning with each other. Welcome to our fern-ical network!
